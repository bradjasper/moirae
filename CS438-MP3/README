created by Joseph Subida and Nadia Tkach
some code snippets copied from Beej's tutorial on TCP and UDP
connections

Files included: 
mp3.h
manager.c
node.c
parser.c
router.c
lsrouting.c
dvrouting.c
Makefile

To run the program execute command "make" on the Unix command line,
then run "./manager protocolNumber networkInfo dataTransferPairs
linkFailures" where protocolNumber is either 1 for link state or
2 for distance vector routing, networkInfo is a file containing
network topology information, dataTransferPairs is a file containing
pairs of node for data transfer, and linkFailures is a file with
information about links between nodes which link cost has been 
changed during the program execution.

manager.c file contains the main function and starts the execution
of the program as a whole. It reads and parse the networkInfo file
specified at the command line, parses the information into an
array of structs with the type node, spawns the number of processes
corresponding to the number of routers on the network. Each router
process executes the routine as specified in router.c file,
establishes TCP connection to the manager and receives the 
information about its node ID, its neighbors and network topology.

based on the choice of a user the routers execute either link state
or distance vector routing protocol routines as specified in
lsrouting.c and dvrouting.c files.
